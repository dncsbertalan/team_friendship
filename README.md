Welcome to Slipstick! This multiplayer game challenges players to escape a cursed labyrinth located beneath the university's central building. Face mysterious enemies, gather unique items, and work with your teammates to find the slipstick, your key to freedom.

# Game Overview
In Slipstick, players become students trapped in a magical labyrinth. Professors and janitors roam the maze, seeking to stop the students from escaping. Players must use their wits to navigate through the rooms, avoid the professors, and collect powerful items to survive and eventually escape.

# Key Features
- Multiplayer Gameplay: Supports multiple players, each taking turns to move and interact with the game environment.

- * FFP2 Mask: Protects players from the effects of toxic gas in certain rooms.
- * Slipstick: The key item that players need to escape the labyrinth and win.
- * Wet Cloth: Disables professors temporarily, giving players a chance to escape or strategize.

- * Special Items: Various items offer tactical advantages like extra moves, temporary immunity, and more.
- * AI-Controlled Professors: Professors patrol the labyrinth and actively pursue players to prevent their escape.
